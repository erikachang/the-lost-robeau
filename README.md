# The Lost Robeau

This is a small project I did as a coursework for a Computation Intelligence course using Jason agents and Hidden Markov Models. 
The scenario is based on the lost robot featured in Russel and Norvig's "Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach".

I'm uploading it just so I'll have a backup of it, as I realise this is not the sexiest code ever written.
